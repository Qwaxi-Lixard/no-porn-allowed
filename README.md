# No Porn Allowed (Last Updated February 16, 2024)
This is a list of sites, services, or tools that ban pornographic or sexual content in any medium (writing, digital/physical illustration, photography, film, or games). While these sites may be usable via a lack of realtime moderation or lax enforcement, you should be extremely causious about becoming dependant on any of these companies.

> For a list of companies, sites, and services that have some allowance for porn, check out ["Yes Porn Allowed"](https://github.com/Qwaxi-Lixard/yes-porn-allowed#yes-porn-allowed).

# A Brief Disclaimer 

This list is very much US centric. I am an American artist and game dev. As such, this list contains either US or Global polocies. If these sites have a different stance for your country, please let me know here or on twitter (@QwaxiLixard). Moreover, I cannot exam every site that exist, so this list will always be non-exhaustive. If there is any site you feel should be added, feel free to send me a message.

*However*, this list is not intended to include sites or services that make clear that sexual content is banned (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Club Panguine, etc). This is only for services that would seem to have no reason to include such a ban. Furthermore, sites that ban "obscene" or "objectionable" content are not include. Most all sites include that as a way to "cover their ass". While those clauses are a risk, this list focuses on explicit bans.

Finally, I'm only human and I'm not a lawyer. So, there maybe some errors or misinterpretation of the "No Porn" clause.

# Company Wide Ban
